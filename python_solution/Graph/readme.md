# Graph

## Definitions

In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type(ADT) which contains vertices and edges and could be classified into undirected graph and directed graph.

**Undirected graph**: edges without direction. *In-dgree* and *out-dgree* of the vertex in undirected graph is the same and equals the number of edges associated with the vertex.
**Directed graph**: edges with direction. *In-degree* of the vertex in directed graph is the number of edges which point to the vertex. *Out-dgree* of the vertex is the number of edges which point from the vertex.

## Representions

### 1. Adjacency List

Every vertex has a list of adjacent vertices. This data structure allows the storage of additonal data on the vertices and edges.

### 2. Adjacency Matrix

A two-dimensional matrix, in which the rows represent source vertices and columns represent destination vertices.

## Algorithms

* BFS
* DFS
* Topological sorting
* The shortest path
* Minimal spanning tree
